# HackerRank

Solutions to algorithm challenges on HackerRank. Done in Java and Python.

This repo contains answers for moderate and advanced challenges (and some easy ones if I learn from them), organized into folders for each subdomain. Please note that HackerRank challenges are often updated, and my answers may be out of date.

# Leetcode

Solutions to algorithm challenges on Leetcode done in Python. This repo was originally for just HackerRank, but for convenience, I'm putting Leetcode stuff here as well.

The leetcode folder contains answers for medium and hard challenges. I like to do random questions with a time limit using Leetcode's mock interview feature, so apologies if any of the code is messy!
